* Language Goals
** Small, self hosted
** Scheme inspired
** Syntax closer to clojure than scheme
** Compile to something with fast startup time - LLVM?
** TCO & %cons
** Optimizing compiler
** No nil?
** No exceptions
** First class Monads
** First class Effects & Coeffects
** Return type polymorphism
** Optional/gradual typing
** S-Expression syntax
** Powerful type system - homoiconic?
** Written literately
** Initially written in clojure
** Tuple types, preferably literal - different from vectors
** Automatic currying? - dunno?
** Different arity functions
